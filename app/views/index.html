          <p>On 20 November 2018 in Hull Benefits Centre:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>6 legacy processors used the prototype</li>
            <li>they struggled to understand how to navigate through the system</li>
            <li>interactions between hub pages and the worklist, and the confirmation pages to the hub pages caused a lot of difficulty</li>
            <li>people also had difficulty understanding the difference between payment and decision history as the information shown on these pages is similar, and is also duplicated content from the timeline</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
